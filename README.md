# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous operations. The provided code showcases a minimal `try-catch` block that does not provide specific error handling, leading to difficulties in debugging and providing meaningful user feedback.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code, whereas `bugSolution.dart` offers a solution with improved error handling.

## How to run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `dart bug.dart` and observe the output in the console. Note the lack of specific error information.
3. Run `dart bugSolution.dart` to see the improved error handling and more descriptive output.
